                                <p dir="ltr"><span>The Holiday hustle and bustle is upon us. It&rsquo;s a joyous
                                        time of year filled with gatherings, celebrations, and what can feel
                                        like a never-ending to-do list. Whether you&rsquo;re hosting family,
                                        feeling financial pressure from holiday expenses, or if the holidays are
                                        a hard time emotionally, it&rsquo;s imperative to prioritize self-care.
                                        There are a variety of self-care practices out there dependent on your
                                        free time and wallet, but one tried and true option that&rsquo;s free
                                        and accessible is self-massage. It&rsquo;s a go-to option that you can
                                        incorporate daily to keep calm, relieve stress, and help promote
                                        relaxation. So, when you don&rsquo;t have the time or funds for a spa
                                        day, look no further than your own two hands.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                        incorporating self-massage into your self-care routine this holiday

                                <p dir="ltr"><strong>Abdominal:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                                <p dir="ltr"><span>Abdominal massages can help ease an upset stomach, alleviate
                                        stomach pain, aid in healthy digestion, reduce bloating, and even help
                                        with bowel movements.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p dir="ltr"><span>Start by Lying on your back somewhere comfortable, like your
                                        bed or a yoga mat. Gently rub your hands together to generate some heat
                                        before placing them on your stomach. Next, you&rsquo;ll want to place
                                        your hands on your abdomen and take a few moments to bring warmth to
                                        this area while you focus on your breath with deep inhales and exhales.
                                        Use gentle pressure and move your hands in circular motions, massaging
                                        your abdomen in a clockwise direction using your palms or fingertips.
                                        This follows the natural path of the digestive system. Imagine you are
                                        tracing the path of your colon. Work your way around your entire
                                        abdomen, including the lower, middle, and upper regions. Spend more time
                                        in areas that feel tense or tight.</span></p>
                                <p dir="ltr"><strong>Lower Back:</strong></p>
                                <p dir="ltr"><span>The lower back often holds tension and can even harbor pain,
                                        which is why this area regularly needs extra TLC.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p dir="ltr"><span>So let the lower back self-massage commence. There are a
                                        variety of massages for the lower back. One to start with is by sitting
                                        on the floor with your legs crossed and a straight back. Start by
                                        focussing on your breath, breathing deeply in and out of the mouth.
                                        Place your thumbs on each side of your sacrum and move them in small
                                        circular motions up and down your sacrum. If you notice any tense spots,
                                        apply some pressure here and release. Repeat this process a few
                                        times.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p dir="ltr"><span>You can also incorporate tools like a foam roller or tennis
                                        ball to get deeper into your fascia and relieve any tension in the lower
                                        back.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p><strong>Face:</strong></p>
                                <p dir="ltr"><span>Have you heard of face yoga? Yes&hellip; it&rsquo;s a thing.
                                        Your face is made up of 50+ muscles and face yoga, along with other face
                                        exercises and massages, helps target these muscles,
                                    </span><span>increase circulation and blood flow, and reduce tension.
                                        It&rsquo;s even possible that tension held in the jaw can affect other
                                        parts of the body.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p dir="ltr"><span>So, want to try to destress and depuff your face? To begin,
                                        you can target </span><span>the under-eye area, which is one of the most
                                        sensitive places on the face. The skin under your eye is thinner than
                                        anywhere else on your face. Ensure the skin on your face is freshly
                                        cleansed. Apply your favorite serum or moisturizer and begin by
                                    </span><span>lightly tapping the area under your eyes with your ring finger.
                                        This tapping motion helps to increase blood flow and can reduce
                                        puffiness. With light pressure, make small, circular motions in a
                                        clockwise direction. Start from the inner corner of your eye and
                                    </span><span>move toward the outer corner. Repeat this several times. For a
                                        lymphatic drainage massage, gently sweep your ring finger from the inner
                                        corner of your eye toward the temples, following the natural curve of
                                        your eye socket. This motion helps to drain excess fluid and reduce
                                        puffiness. Repeat the massage on the other eye using the same
                                        techniques. If you&rsquo;d like, you can incorporate a gua sha tool or
                                        roller in your massage mix.&nbsp;</span></p>
