                HOW</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.&nbsp;PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY</strong>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><span><br /></span><span>We understand that your medical
                information is private and confidential. Further, we are required by law to maintain the privacy
                of &ldquo;protected health information.&rdquo; &ldquo;Protected health information&rdquo; or
                &ldquo;PHI&rdquo; includes any individually identifiable information that we obtain from you or
                others that relates to your past, present, or future physical or mental health, the health care
                you have received, or payment for your health care. As necessary, we will share protected health
                information with one another to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations relating
                to the services to be rendered and/or any entity under the New York Cancer &amp; Blood
                Specialists network umbrella.</span></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><span>As required by law, this notice provides you with information about your rights and
                our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to the privacy of PHI. This notice also
                discusses the uses and disclosures we will make of your PHI. We must comply with the provisions
                of this notice as currently in effect, although we reserve the right to change the terms of this
                notice from time to time and to make the revised notice effective for all PHI we maintain. You
                can always request a written copy of our most current privacy notice from our reception team or
                on our website.</span><span><br /><br /></span></p>
        <p><strong>PERMITTED USES AND DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><span>We can use or disclose your PHI for purposes of </span><span>treatment, payment, and
                health care operations</span><span>. We have provided a description and an example for each of
                these uses and disclosures below. However, not every particular use or disclosure in every
                category will be listed.</span><span><br /><br /></span></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><span>Treatment means the provision, coordination, or management of your health care,
                including consultations between health care providers relating to your care and referrals for
                health care from one health care provider to another. For example, a doctor treating you for a
                broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing process.
                In addition, the doctor may need to contact a physical therapist to create the exercise regimen
                appropriate for your treatment.</span><span><br /><br /></span></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><span>Payment means the activities we undertake to obtain reimbursement for the health care
                provided to you, including billing, collections, claims management, determination of eligibility
                and coverage, and other utilization review activities. For example, we may need to provide PHI
                to your Third-Party Payor to determine whether the proposed course of treatment will be covered.
                When we subsequently bill the Third Party Payor for the services rendered to you, we can provide
                the Third Party Payor with information regarding your care if necessary to obtain payment.
                Federal or State law may require us to obtain a written release from you before disclosing
                certain specially protected PHI for payment purposes. We will ask you to sign a release when
                necessary under applicable law.</span><span><br /><br /></span></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><span>Health care operations mean the support functions of and/or any entity under the New
                York Cancer &amp; Blood Specialists network umbrella. related to treatment and payment, such as
                quality assurance activities, case management, receiving and responding to patient comments and
                complaints, physician reviews, compliance programs, audits, business planning, development,
                management, and administrative activities. For example, we may use your PHI to evaluate the
                performance of our staff when caring for you. We may also combine PHI with many patients to
                decide what additional services we should offer, what services are not needed, and whether
                certain new treatments are effective. We may also disclose PHI for review and learning purposes.
                In addition, we may remove information that identifies you so that others can use the
                de-identified information to study health care and health care delivery without learning who you
                are.</span><span><br /><br /></span></p>
        <p><strong>OTHER USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><span>We may also use your PHI in the following ways:</span></p>

                        your care. We may use or disclose your PHI to notify or assist in the notification of a
                        family member, a personal representative, or another person responsible for the care of
                        your location, general condition, or death. If you are available, we will give you an

                        our professional judgment.</span></p>

                        medication. All research projects are subject to a special approval process that
